So, interesting story behind this silly project. One of the Senior Managers on my team asked me to convert demo videos from WMV to MP4 format as requested by a Partner. And the idea hit, xd. So, I first converted the video to MP4 using Python code, then thought, let's be creative. In about 30-40 minutes or so, I created a Streamlit application for this, created a GitHub repo, deployed it on Streamlit Cloud, and sent the link along with the video to her. 

It was fun, xd. Had my dinner smiling the whole time after what I did, lol. 

Learning by building one silly project at a time.

To convert videos into MP4 format. Upload any video format to convert it into MP4.
